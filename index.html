        <h3>What's This?</h3>

        <p>This is a PCB that brings sanity to Raspberry Pi headers.</p>

        <p><img src="https://github.com/joewalnes/pi-crust/raw/master/images/prototype.jpg" alt="Pi Crust prototype"></p>
        <p>(Early Prototype: Note the main 26 pin connector is not in this photo)</p>

        <p>(PCB)</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> is the new play toy for hackers. This board extends
        the Raspberry Pi, making it easy to interface with the low level peripheral interfaces.</p>


        <h3>Features</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Really compact - sits <em>inside</em> the surface area of the Raspberry Pi and adds less than 2mm to the height.
          If you have a case for your Raspberry Pi, this board should fit inside it.</li>
          <li>Pins are grouped together: GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART and power.</li>
          <li>Every pin is clearly labelled.</li>
          <li>Connections: 2 x SPI, 2 x I2C, 1 x UART, 8 x GPIO.</li>
          <li>Uses female headers instead of male headers - you can poke jumpers right in.</li>
          <li>Lots of GND and 5V pins - you need those guys a lot. These pins are duplicated
          where it makes sense (e.g. within the UART, I2C and SPI groups).</li>
          <li>All thru-hole components - you can solder it yourself.</li>
          <li>Cheapety cheapy cheap.</li>
          <li>Open source hardware.</li>

        <h3>About Design</h3>

        <p>The toughest part of this design was making it fit inside a Raspberry Pi. The existing Raspberry Pi headers
        actually go all the way through the board and it sits approximately 2mm above the Raspberry Pi (very close).
        It's almost as if the board was part of the original board.</p>

        <p>Because it sits so close to the Raspberry Pi, care has been taken
        to ensure that any thru-hole components avoid components on the Raspberry Pi board (so they don't short them out),
        and to avoid restricting air getting to the main ARM processor.</p>

        <h3>I Want One!</h3>

        <p>I don't sell these. But you can order the parts and assemble it yourself. If you can do basic soldering, you're all set. It's very easy.</p>


        <h4>Ordering the PCB</h4>

        <p>I recommend ordering the PCB from <a href="http://oshpark.com" target="_blank">OSHPark.com</a>.

        <p>If you're unfamiliar with this service, it allows you to upload a PCB and they'll get it made for you. The minimum you can order is 3 - give some to your friends.</p>

        <p>Ordering 3 Pi Crust PCBs from OSHPark should cost about $13.80 and take 2-4 weeks to arrive.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/joewalnes/pi-crust/raw/master/pi-crust.brd">PCB layout file</a> (right click, save as).
          <li>Go to <a href="http://oshpark.com" target="_blank">OSHPark.com</a>, click 'Get Started Now', and upload the file.
          Follow the instructions and you'll receive some high quality PCBs in a few weeks time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Assembly Instructions</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>If you ordered the PCB through OSHPark.com, there may be additional tabs attached to some of the edges of the PCB. You should remove these with pliers or cutters.</li>
          <li>Insert the big 26 pin connector into the board from the top. The top is the side with all the labels next to the pins. There is only one place the connector will fit.</li>
          <li>Flip board over and solder the 26 pin connnector in place from the bottom. You'll notice there are 4 rows of holes - the outer rows are the ones you want to solder. The inner ones should be left as is, as that's how the Raspberry Pi connects.</li>
          <li>Flip board back over to the top and insert the remaining female headers. Flip over to the bottom to solder in place.</li>
          <li>Take the 1x2 male header and remove the metal (easiest with pliers). You don't need the metal part. You should be left with a little piece of black plastic. Break it in half. Take the two parts and glue them to the bottom of the PCB, in the spaces marked with little squares. These act as little feet for the board to prevent it from pressing against the Raspberry Pi.</li>
          <li>Go play.</li>
        </ul>
