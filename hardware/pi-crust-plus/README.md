Design your own Raspberry Pi HAT, attach custom circuitry and otherwise dress your Raspberry Pi with this prototyping HAT kit with EEPROM.

The Pi Crust ProtoHAT has a grid of prototyping soldering holes for attaching chips, resistors, LED, potentiometers and more. The holes are connected underneath with traces to mimic the solderless breadboards. We break out nearly every pin you could want to connect to the Raspberry Pi.

It comes with a printed circuit board and a single 2x20 GPIO Header for Raspberry Pi already soldered to save you time. This version comes with a blank 24C32 I2C EEPROM soldered on and connected to the EEDAT/EECLK lines so you cannot 'stack' it with other HATs. However, you can program in the EEPROM to make a self-identifying setup using the Raspberry Pi Foundations' HAT specifications.

This HAT is compatible with the Raspberry Pi Zero, A+, B+, 2, 3, 3B+ etc (any Pi with 2x20 connector).
